### Project Conda Environment

See the shared [environment.yml](./environment.yml) file. Create a local environment at your computer with command 
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
For the packages cannot be installed with the above conda command, you may consider to install via pip instead.

## Organization of the project source code, data and model checkpoints

### Source code

This project source code is divided into two directories:
- **LLM_Tuning [link](https://github.com/jwzhanggy/Graph_Toolformer/tree/main/LLM_Tuning)**: Language model fine-tuning code with graph reasoning prompt dataset
- **Graph_Toolformer_Package [link](https://github.com/jwzhanggy/Graph_Toolformer/tree/main/Graph_Toolformer_Package)**: The Graph-Toolformer reasoning demo code, which will load the fine-tuned LLMs (by the LLM_Tuning code) and the other pre-trained GNN models.

### Dataset

The datasets used in this paper inclode both the the generated graph reasoning prompt datasets, and the benchmark datasets of the graphs
- **Prompt Datasets [link](https://github.com/jwzhanggy/Graph_Toolformer/tree/main/LLM_Tuning/prompt)**: The graph reasoning prompts created in this paper for LLM fine-tuning. The prompt dataset has been included in the LLM_Tuning directory already.
- **Graph Raw Datasets [link](https://github.com/jwzhanggy/Graph_Toolformer/tree/main/Graph_Toolformer_Package/graph_datasets)**: The 15 graph benchmark datasets used in this paper. The graph raw dataset (about 100MB) should be download from the google drive.

### Model checkpoints

The pre-trained/fine-tuned model checkpoints released by this project also have two parts
- **Fine-tuned LLM Checkpoint [link](https://github.com/jwzhanggy/Graph_Toolformer/tree/main/Graph_Toolformer_Package/koala/language_models)**: The checkpoint of fine-tuned language model by the above LLM_Tuning code, readers can either tune the LLMs by yourselves or use the provided checkpoint by us. If you plan to use the checkpoint released by us, you may need to download it from the Google drive, and the zip file is about 5GB.
- **Pre-trained GNN Checkpoints [link](https://github.com/jwzhanggy/Graph_Toolformer/tree/main/Graph_Toolformer_Package/koala/graph_models)**: We use 5 different graph models in this project, the checkpoints of the pre-trained GNNs are also provided. The readers can either pre-train their own graph models, or use the pre-trained graph model checkpoints released by us, which can be downloaded from Google drive. The zip file is about 100MB, and the upziped folder can be about 5GB.

## How to play with the code?

### Environment setup

First of all, as mentioned above, please set up the environment for running the code. We recommend you create the code environment with the [environment.yml file](https://github.com/jwzhanggy/Graph_Toolformer/blob/main/environment.yml) shared from us. You can create the environment with the following command

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

For the packages cannot be installed with the above conda command, you may consider to install via pip.

### Play with LLM_Tuning code

After downloading the LLM_Tuning directory, installing the conda environment ([**see this file**](https://github.com/jwzhanggy/Graph_Toolformer/blob/main/environment.yml)), you can just go ahead to run the code with the following command to start the LLMs fine-tuning with the prompt datasets:

> **Note**
> 
> **1.** To avoid getting OOM, depending on your machine (GPU memory capacty), please also adjust the batch_size and max_length parameters accordingly.
> 
> **2.** For 8bit models, it seems some CPU will not support the mixed precision computation. We recommend you use GPU instead of CPU for running the code.
> 
> **3.** If you plan to use the fine-tuned LLM checkpoint for graph reasoning, please (1) replace the fine-tuned checkpoints in the downloaded **Graph_Toolformer_Package/koala/language_models/gptj_8bit/local_data/finetuned_model/graph_toolformer_GPTJ** directory of the Graph_Toolformer_Package for graph reasoning demos, (2) also remember to change the checkpoint names to **graph_toolformer_GPTJ** before pasting it to the koala folder, so the demo framework will load the checkpoint.

```
python3 gtoolformer_gptj_script.py
```

For more information, you can also refer to the [README.md provided in the LLM_Tuning directory](https://github.com/jwzhanggy/Graph_Toolformer/tree/main/LLM_Tuning) as well.
