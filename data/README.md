# Data used in Graph-Toolformer Framework.

The data used in graph-toolformer include four parts, which are shared via Google Drive:

- **1. Graph Raw Datasets**: about 15 different graph benchmark datasets are used in this project
- **2. Graph Reasoning Prompt Dataset**: the designed prompts for graph reasoning tasks on these 15 graph benchmark datasets
- **3. Pre-trained Graph Model Checkpoints**: 5 different pre-trained graph models are used for various graph reasoning tasks
- **4. Fine-tuned Language Model Checkpoints**: fine-tuned language models for different graph reasoning tasks
